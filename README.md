# F1 Data Analysis Pipeline
# Overview

This project provides a Python-based pipeline for analyzing Formula 1 race data. It processes datasets related to lap times, race results, qualifying positions, and driver standings to answer key performance questions. The pipeline uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to calculate correlations, visualize trends, and extract insights from race data.

# Why?
Formula 1 race data is publicly available and can provide valuable insights into driver performance, race trends, and consistency across the season. This project helps to analyze and understand aspects like lap time consistency, pole-to-podium conversion, and race duration deviations. It offers a framework to explore these data points, providing useful tools for researchers, analysts, and fans alike.
